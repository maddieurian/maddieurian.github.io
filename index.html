            <p class="bio"> Hi! My name is Maddie and I am currently a junior at Virginia Tech. I study Public Relations and Real Estate, but I also have a strong passion for many of my personal hobbies, giving back to my community, and all things crime! This website serves as a home for some of my digital media-related coursework for a class that I've been enrolled in this semester. Enjoy!</p>

        <p class="description">
          It is no secret that social media has had an effect on how people view the world around them. In terms of crime coverage and opinions surrounding it, there is absolutely no exception to this "secret."
