            <p class="bio"> Hi! My name is Maddie and I am currently a junior at Virginia Tech. I study Public Relations and Real Estate, but I also have a strong passion for many of my personal hobbies, spending time with friends and family, giving back to my community, and (of course) food! This website serves as a home for some of my digital media-related coursework for a class that I am enrolled in this semester.</p>

            It is no secret that social media has had an effect on how people view the world around them. In terms of serious matters, including crime coverage and opinions surrounding it, there is absolutely no exception to this "secret." This podcast showcases a discussion between students, who are very aware with the media and how it works, about how the use of social media has had an effect on well-known crimes in the past, as well as how it can continue to affect these motions in the future."
